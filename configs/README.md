A valid configuration directory contains three files:

- `main.json`
- `food.csv`
- `pets.csv`

Please see the examples provided in the `default` folder for required keys of `main.json` and required columns for `food.csv` and `pets.csv`. For `food.csv` and `pets.csv`, the "empty" food and the "empty" pet must be specified as the first non-header row.

**NOTE:** The format of the configuration files are subject to change.
